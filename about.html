                    <h3>Creative Philosophy</h3>
                    <p>I am heavily inspired by music subcultures like punk, both ideologically and aesthetically. The curation of clothing better expresses that subculture through preference for dark colors, leather, and clothing with metal hardware. In contrast, my art maintains the ideological focus and its inherent 'funness' despite the often hard looking exterior. I corporate the pro-humanity ideals through nostalgia and lightness while still being grounded.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Sustainability & Practice</h3>
                    <p>All my works are individually produced or were acquired second-hand. Small-batch and recycled materials are necessary to preventing the continued destruction of nature for human consumption. Each year, 92 million tons of waste are produced by the fashion industry alone, though individual action is miniscule in comparison, change is still possible through collective action.</p>


                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p>I am a second-year student at NYU majoring in Philosophy and minoring in BEMT. Though my academic studies are not artistic I have been an artist for my entire life and I strongly believe that art informs philosophy and vice versa. Aside from that, I also love baking, film, and literature. Mainly, I want to make the world a better place, or at least try to.</p>
